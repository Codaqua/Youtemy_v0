# Youtemy v0.1
#### By Jesús Arcis Díaz

## Overview

Development of Youtemy, an educational platform that offers free courses in video format, based on curated content from YouTube, as a development of the Final Degree Project at the UOC. 

The goal is to create an educational platform that offers educational itineraries adapted to the specific needs of each individual according to the syllabus they are studying at any given time.

## Methodology and Objectives:

Lean Startup Methodology: For the development of this project, a Lean approach will be followed, to obtain early feedback and delivering value to users as soon as possible. This approach involves gradually incorporating additional features that add value.  

Therefore, the focus is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can be tested with users as early as possible and obtain valuable feedback, which can be used to iterate and improve the product. 

## Stages

* Identification of the problem: Overdose of information on YouTube, which leads the student to waste a great deal of time searching for the right content across all subjects. Loss of concentration due to the continuous flood of entertainment videos. As a result, students have poor learning performance and a decrease in their attention span.

* Solution ideation: After the development of different processes of ideation of solutions, the development of an educational platform with content curation from YouTube is determined.

* UI Mock-up modelling: A visual representation of the product's user interface is created. It is used to communicate the design and functionality of the product to stakeholders (university students) and get feedback from users.

* Development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP): With the feedback obtained, the MVP. A simplified version of the final product is developed with the minimum features necessary to test and validate the idea. The objective of this phase is to put the product in the hands of the users as soon as possible to continue obtaining feedback and validate the hypotheses.

* Iterative development: Based on feedback from users, the product is refined and improved in iterative cycles. This involves clearing uncertainties, adding new features, making design changes and improving functionality to enhance the user experience, as seamlessly as possible.


## Instructions for using the Mockup:
Specific objectives: 
* Simulate Login to the platform and access the Home page.
* Simulate the Search for the specific content of a subject, in a specific University, identifying the degree and the grade. For this Mockup, the fictional objective is to emulate the search for specific Algebra courses, being a student in the first semester of the Computer Engineering degree at the UOC.
* Simulate the access to the content of a course and the use of the control of the progression in the itinerary of said course, through the information path bar on the right column.
